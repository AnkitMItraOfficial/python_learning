 A quick intro about Myself--
 
Well, being a school boy You don't get enough time to code, you have school and tution homework to deal with, also you have to self-study (who wants to hear my boring stories, let's go the point).

I am Ankit Mitra and I'm 15 years old and I code for fun, I Started coding because I want to be a hacker, but I switched to back-end development, how evil!

Why this repository?

This repository consists of my Python learning and also I will include projects, well if you want you can give a look at the code

Thank You!
